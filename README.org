* netPron2 : Prononciation scoring, data collection, testing, and grading

** Prerequisites

*** Ant installed

** Deployment

*** 1) git submodule update --init â€“recursive
*** 2) in war/WEB-INF/web.xml choose which config you would like to use, e.g. urdu

This will control which of config directory under war/config/<name> will be used

*** 3) ant warUrdu (or other config target), this will produce npUrduData.war
*** 4) copy the war 
Either copy the war directly into the webapps directory of the webserver OR 
jar xf npUrduDara.war into another directory and then cp -r <other dir> <webapps dir>
The second option would be good if you want to rename the webapp to be something else.
If so, also change the title property in config.properties in war/config/urdu/config.properties (or equivalent)
