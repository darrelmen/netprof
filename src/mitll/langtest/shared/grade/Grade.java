/**
 * Represents a grade of a {@link mitll.langtest.shared.Result} by a grader.
 * <br></br>
 * So it has a reference to a result id, a grade, the name of the grader, and the grade type.
 * <br></br>
 * The type allows us to differentiate between "english-only" grades and "arabic" grades.
 * <br></br>
 * For instance, we don't want to show arabic grades to the english only people and vice-versa.
 *
 * Grader logs in, registering initially.
 *
 * On the left, questions sorted (not random), each shows how many have been graded (n graders, # complete) and
 * how many responses were collected for the item (which could be a multi part question).
 *
 * E.g. if 2 graders, each could be part way done with responses and so 0 complete.
 *
 * Need a Grade object which will be for each entry in the results table.
 *
 * Either 1-5 scale or that + a Correct? Yes/No scale.  Maybe this is an option in the nature of the exercise?
 *
 * Show question, with table of responses. Note which have been graded so far.
